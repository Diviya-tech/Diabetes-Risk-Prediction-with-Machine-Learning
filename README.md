# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

This project applies machine learning to predict diabetes risk, focusing on key feature selection, interpretability, and comparative model performance. You'll find data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, decision tree visualizations, Gini/Entropy impurity analysis, and KNN model tuning.

## **Contents**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Key attribute distributions, correlations, and missing value checks.
- **Feature Selection:** Identification of the most influential features for diabetes risk using random forest importance.
- **Decision Tree Models:** Comparing Gini and Entropy criteria with interpretable visualizations and impurity metrics.
- **KNN Model Tuning:** Optimizing K with cross-validation and the elbow method; analyzing misclassification errors.
- **Model Performance:** Cross-validated accuracy, best K selection, and top features for each algorithm.
